# Homework 7

- Sliding navigation with a side panel list showing current picture collection.
- Maintaining 2 collections:
  - `DLinkedList` for main navigation.
  - `ObservableArrayList` for side panel.
- MVC design pattern (without the model class).

> ## Instructions
>
> **ImageViewer (Generic Linked List)**
>
> Modify the doubly linked list class presented in this chapter so it works with
  generic types. Add the following methods drawn from the java.util.List
  interface:
>
> - `void clear()`: remove all elements from the list.
> - `E get(int index)`: return the element at position index in the list.
> - `E set(int index, E element)`: replace the element at the specified position
    with the specified element and return the previous element.
>
> Test your generic linked list class by creating a JavaFX application that can
  perform Create, Read, Update and Delete actions on a list of images. The list
  should be contained in a doubly linked list that can be saved as a playlist
  file. Your application should use the FileChooser control to allow the user to
  choose a playlist file to open. It should also use the FileChooser control to
  allow the user to choose an image to the playlist. When a playlist file is
  opened, your application should display the first image.
>
> Your GUI should
>
> - include Next and Previous buttons allowing the user to navigate to next and
    previous images
> - include controls to Update (add and delete images to/from) a list
> - include a way to Create a new list
>
> **Instructions**
>
> Create a wireframe and plan your application. You probably need a wireframe
  for C, R, U and D.
