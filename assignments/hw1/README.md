- `Employee` is a data class that holds employee's information.
- `App` is a driver class that creates three `Employee` objects and displays
  their information.

> ## Instructions
>
> **Employee Class**
>
> Write a class named **Employee** that has the following fields:
>
> - `name`. The name field references a String object that holds the employee’s
    name.
> - `idNumber`. The idNumber is an int variable that holds the employee’s ID
    number.
> - `department`. The department field references a String object that holds the
    name of the department where the employee works.
> - `position`. The position field references a String object that holds the
    employee’s job title.
>
> The class should have the following constructors:
>
> - A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns
    them to the appropriate fields: employee’s name, employee’s ID number,
    department, and position.
> - A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns
    them to the appropriate fields: employee’s name and ID number. The
    department and position fields should be assigned an empty string ("").
> - A no-arg constructor that assigns empty strings ("") to the name,
    department, and position fields, and 0 to the idNumber field.
>
> Write appropriate mutator methods that store values in these fields and
  accessor methods that return the values in these fields. Once you have written
  the class, write a separate program that creates three Employee objects to
  hold the following data:
>
> | Name | ID Number | Department | Position |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | Susan Meyers | 8647765 | IT | Sr Programmer/Analyst |
> | Ahmad Karim | 5424130 | Purchasing | Manager |
> | Alfonso Kirkpatrick | 1243452 | Sales | Vice President |
>
> The program should store this data in the three objects and then display the
  data for each employee on the screen.
>
> ### Please submit the following:
>
> 1. The compressed (zipped) folder containing your **_entire_** project
> 2. A captured image of your screen showing your program’s output
