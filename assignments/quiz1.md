- Constructors
- Passing Objects as Arguments
- Overloading Methods and Constructors
- Scope of Instance Fields
- Packages and import Statements

## Problem 1

> Methods that operate on an object's fields are called
>
> 1.  public methods
> 1.  private methods
> 1.  instance methods
> 1.  dinstance variables

**C.** instance methods

## Problem 2


> A(n) ______ can be thought of as a blueprint that can be used to create a type
  of ______.
>
> 1.  class, object
> 1.  object, class
> 1.  object, method
> 1.  cookie, cake

**A.** class, object

## Problem 3

> A group of related classes is called a(n) ______.
>
> 1.  package
> 1.  archive
> 1.  collection
> 1.  attachment

**A.** package

## Problem 4

> The scope of a private instance field is ______.
>
> 1.  inside the class but not inside any method in that class
> 1.  the instance methods of the same class
> 1.  the method in which it is defined
> 1.  inside the parentheses of a method header

**B.** the instance methods of the same class

## Problem 5

> Which of the following statements will create a reference, `str`, to the
  `String "Hello, World"`?
>
> 1.  `String str = new "Hello, World"`;
> 1.  `str = "Hello, World"`;
> 1.  `string str = "Hello, World"`;
> 1.  `String str = "Hello, World"`;

**D.** `String str = "Hello, World"`;

## Problem 6

> Which symbol indicates that a member is public in a UML diagram?
>
> 1.  \+
> 1.  \-
> 1.  \*
> 1.  \#

**A.** \+

## Problem 7

> ______ refers to combining data and code into a single object.
>
> 1.  Data hiding
> 1.  Abstraction
> 1.  The constructor
> 1.  Encapsulation

**D.** Encapsulation

## Problem 8

> What does the following UML diagram entry mean?
>
> ```
> + setHeight(h: double) : void
> ```
>
> 1.  a private field called `setHeight` that is a `double` data type.
> 1.  a public method with a parameter of data type `double` that does not
      return a value.
> 1.  a public field called `setHeight` that is a `double` data type.
> 1.  a private method with no parameters that returns a `double` data type.

**B.** a public method with a parameter of data type `double` that does not
return a value

## Problem 9

> Data hiding (which means that critical data stored inside the object is
  protected from code outside the object) is accomplished in Java by ______.
>
> 1.  using the public access specifier on the class methods
> 1.  using the private access specifier on the class definition
> 1.  using the private access specifier on the class fields
> 1.  using the private access specifier on the class methods

**C.** using the private access specifier on the class fields

## Problem 10

> An access specifier indicates how a class may be accessed.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 11

> The term "no-arg constructor" is applied to any constructor that does not
  accept arguments.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 12

> When a local variable in an instance method has the same name as an instance
  field, the instance field hides the local variable.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**B.** False
