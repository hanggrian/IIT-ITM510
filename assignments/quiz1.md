## Problem 1

> Methods that operate on an object's fields are called
>
> 1. public methods
> 2. private methods
> 3. instance methods
> 4. dinstance variables

**C**. instance methods

## Problem 2


> A(n) ______ can be thought of as a blueprint that can be used to create a type
  of ______.
>
> 1. class, object
> 2. object, class
> 3. object, method
> 4. cookie, cake

**A**. class, object

## Problem 3

> A group of related classes is called a(n) ______.
>
> 1. package
> 2. archive
> 3. collection
> 4. attachment

**A**. package

## Problem 4

> The scope of a private instance field is ______.
>
> 1. inside the class but not inside any method in that class
> 2. the instance methods of the same class
> 3. the method in which it is defined
> 4. inside the parentheses of a method header

**B**. the instance methods of the same class

## Problem 5

> Which of the following statements will create a reference, `str`, to the
  `String "Hello, World"`?
>
> 1. `String str = new "Hello, World"`;
> 2. `str = "Hello, World"`;
> 3. `string str = "Hello, World"`;
> 4. `String str = "Hello, World"`;

**D**. `String str = "Hello, World"`;

## Problem 6

> Which symbol indicates that a member is public in a UML diagram?
>
> 1. \+
> 2. \-
> 3. \*
> 4. \#

**A**. \+

## Problem 7

> ______ refers to combining data and code into a single object.
>
> 1. Data hiding
> 2. Abstraction
> 3. The constructor
> 4. Encapsulation

**D**. Encapsulation

## Problem 8

> What does the following UML diagram entry mean?
>
> ```
> + setHeight(h: double) : void
> ```
>
> 1. a private field called `setHeight` that is a `double` data type
> 2. a public method with a parameter of data type `double` that does not return
     a value
> 3. a public field called `setHeight` that is a `double` data type
> 4. a private method with no parameters that returns a `double` data type

**B**. a public method with a parameter of data type `double` that does not
return a value

## Problem 9

> Data hiding (which means that critical data stored inside the object is
  protected from code outside the object) is accomplished in Java by ______.
>
> 1. using the public access specifier on the class methods
> 2. using the private access specifier on the class definition
> 3. using the private access specifier on the class fields
> 4. using the private access specifier on the class methods

**C**. using the private access specifier on the class fields

## Problem 10

> An access specifier indicates how a class may be accessed.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A**. True

## Problem 11

> The term "no-arg constructor" is applied to any constructor that does not
  accept arguments.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A**. True

## Problem 12

> When a local variable in an instance method has the same name as an instance
  field, the instance field hides the local variable.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**B**. False
