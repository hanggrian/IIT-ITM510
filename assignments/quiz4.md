- [Testing Java.pdf](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-ITM510/blob/assets/lect3_1.pdf)

## Problem 1

> What is the purpose of annotations in testing frameworks?
>
> 1.  Automatically generate code
> 1.  Improve code readability and maintainability
> 1.  Replace manual testing
> 1.  Enhance code execution speed

**B.** Improve code readability and maintainability

## Problem 2

> Which of the following are objectives of using test frameworks in Java?
>
> 1.  Automate the testing process
> 1.  Generate code documentation
> 1.  Improve code maintainability
> 1.  Simplify code writing

- **A.** Automate the testing process
- **C.** Improve code maintainability
- **D.** Simplify code writing

## Problem 3

> What is the purpose of test frameworks in Java?
>
> 1.  Simplify code writing
> 1.  Automate the testing process
> 1.  Generate code documentation
> 1.  All of the above

**B.** Automate the testing process

## Problem 4

> What is the purpose of the `@Retention` annotation in Java?
>
> 1.  Configure the retention policy of annotations
> 1.  Enable or disable annotation processing
> 1.  Control the visibility of annotations
> 1.  Specify the annotation type

**A.** Configure the retention policy of annotations

## Problem 5

> Which JUnit annotation is used to indicate that a method is a test case?
>
> 1.  `@Case`
> 1.  `@Test`
> 1.  `@Unit`
> 1.  `@Method`

**B.** `@Test`

## Problem 6

> What does the `@Ignore` annotation in JUnit do?
>
> 1.  Skips the entire test class.
> 1.  Disables JUnit for the annotated method.
> 1.  Marks a test method to be ignored during test execution.
> 1.  Enables parallel execution for the annotated test.

**C.** Marks a test method to be ignored during test execution.

## Problem 7

> Annotations in Java are processed by testing tools during compilation, and
  they can generate code or perform validation based on these annotations.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 8

> The `@Ignore` annotation in JUnit skips the annotated test method during test
  execution.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True

## Problem 9

> Annotations in Java can be retained at runtime by default.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**B.** False

## Problem 10

> The Before annotation in JUnit indicates a method to be executed before each
  test method.
>
> 1.  True
> 1.  False

**A.** True
