- [Testing Java.pdf](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-ITM510/blob/assets/lect3_1.pdf)

## Problem 1

> What is the purpose of annotations in testing frameworks?
>
> 1. Automatically generate code
> 2. Improve code readability and maintainability
> 3. Replace manual testing
> 4. Enhance code execution speed

**B.** Improve code readability and maintainability

## Problem 2

> Which of the following are objectives of using test frameworks in Java?
>
> 1. Automate the testing process
> 2. Generate code documentation
> 3. Improve code maintainability
> 4. Simplify code writing

- **A.** Automate the testing process
- **C.** Improve code maintainability
- **D.** Simplify code writing

## Problem 3

> What is the purpose of test frameworks in Java?
>
> 1. Simplify code writing
> 2. Automate the testing process
> 3. Generate code documentation
> 4. All of the above

**B.** Automate the testing process

## Problem 4

> What is the purpose of the `@Retention` annotation in Java?
>
> 1. Configure the retention policy of annotations
> 2. Enable or disable annotation processing
> 3. Control the visibility of annotations
> 4. Specify the annotation type

**A.** Configure the retention policy of annotations

## Problem 5

> Which JUnit annotation is used to indicate that a method is a test case?
>
> 1. `@Case`
> 2. `@Test`
> 3. `@Unit`
> 4. `@Method`

**B.** `@Test`

## Problem 6

> What does the `@Ignore` annotation in JUnit do?
>
> 1. Skips the entire test class.
> 2. Disables JUnit for the annotated method.
> 3. Marks a test method to be ignored during test execution.
> 4. Enables parallel execution for the annotated test.

**C.** Marks a test method to be ignored during test execution.

## Problem 7

> Annotations in Java are processed by testing tools during compilation, and
  they can generate code or perform validation based on these annotations.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True

## Problem 8

> The `@Ignore` annotation in JUnit skips the annotated test method during test
  execution.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True

## Problem 9

> Annotations in Java can be retained at runtime by default.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**B.** False

## Problem 10

> The Before annotation in JUnit indicates a method to be executed before each
  test method.
>
> 1. True
> 2. False

**A.** True
