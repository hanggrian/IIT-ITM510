> ## Instructions
>
> **ArrayList Operations**
>
> Write a program with an ArrayList that is populated with at least 200 random
  values in the range of -50 to 150. Use any primitive data type of your choice.
  The program should also have the following methods:
>
> - `getTotal`. This method should accept a one-dimensional array as its
    argument and return the total of the values in the array.
> - `getAverage`. This method should accept a one-dimensional array as its
    argument and return the average of the values in the array.
> - `getHighest`. This method should accept a one-dimensional array as its
    argument and return the highest value in the array.
> - `getLowest`. This method should accept a one-dimensional array as its
    argument and return the lowest value in the array.
>
> Demonstrate each of the methods in the program.
>
