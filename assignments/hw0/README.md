## 0.2 Create your program heading

> Each programming assignment in this course is required to be well documented.
  Good documentation begins with a program heading. Every source code file
  should start with heading comments including the following in no particular
  order:
>
> - the name of the programmer,
> - the course number,
> - the date,
> - the name of the assignment, and
> - a description of what the included code does
>
> Using a text editor, create a text file called `heading.txt` that contains
  this information. Your heading should be 25 lines or less.
